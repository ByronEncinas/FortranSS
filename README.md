# FortranSS (Library for Statistics and Math)

The idea is that all the results from the method that take large population samples as input, will
be compatible with the input of all the Plotting functions as well.

- [x] Object Particle: initialize(mass, init_pos, init_vel, charge, ...), displacement updates method
- [ ] Next Features in Object Particle: Electric Field, Grav Field created by it.
- [x] Object Calculus: First Derivative Second Derivative, Euler Method, Simpsons Method (1/3,1/8,3/8)
- [ ] Next Features in Object Calculus: Runge Kutta Methods, Simplectic Integrator Feature (for all prev methods)
- [x] Object Matrix: Initialize or declare by command line, Levi-Civita Tensor (Eijk only)
- [ ] Next Features in Matrix: Gauss-Jordan Method, Trace of Matrix, Determinant, Inverse, LU Decomposition

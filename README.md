# FortranSS (Library for Statistics and Math)

The idea is that all the results from the method that take large population samples as input, will
be compatible with the input of all the Plotting functions as well.

- [ ] ./src/Statistic -> Significant Numbers or Standard Error (Plus-Minus Deviations)
